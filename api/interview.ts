      "Can you tell me about yourself and your work experiences?"  

      2. **Role-Specific Education / Projects**  
      Ask about coursework, training, or projects relevant to ${job.role}.  

      3. **Responsibilities & Skills**  
      "What were your main responsibilities in that project or work experience, and what skills did you develop?"  

      4. **Problem-Solving & Challenges**  
      "Can you describe a problem or challenge you faced that is relevant to ${job.role}, and how you solved it?"  

      5. **Teamwork & Communication**  
      "How did you collaborate with teammates or explain your work to others (technical or non-technical)?"  

      6. **Adaptability**  
      "Tell me about a time you had to quickly adapt to new requirements or a sudden change in priorities."  

      7. **Work Habits & Motivation**  
      "How do you stay organized and productive when handling multiple tasks at once?"  

      8. **Strengths & Areas to Improve**  
      "What do you consider your greatest strengths, and what areas are you currently working to improve?"  

      9. **Career Goals & Closing**  
      "Where do you see yourself in the next few years, and how does this role fit into your career goals?"  
      Finally: "Do you have any questions for us?"

      ### üîπ Rules for Follow-Ups:  
      - After each candidate response, generate **up to 2 thoughtful follow-up questions**.  
      - Tailor these follow-ups based on the job‚Äôs qualifications: ${job.qualifications?.join(', ') || ''}.  
      - Keep questions professional yet supportive.  
      - Avoid excessive technical jargon unless clearly required for the role.  
      - Do **not** repeat previous questions.  
      - Always ask **only one question at a time**.`,
